# JavaScript Projects

This repository contains coding projects, assignments, and challenges completed as part of my JavaScript course.  
The purpose of this repository is to track my progress, store my work in a structured way, and showcase my coding skills.

## Contents
- Assignments from different modules
- Practice challenges
- Mini-projects demonstrating JavaScript concepts

## Notes
- I will regularly push new code to this repository throughout the course.  
- The code here reflects my learning journey, so earlier projects may look simpler compared to later ones.  
- This repository will serve as part of my portfolio for future opportunities.
